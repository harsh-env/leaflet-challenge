# Leaflet-challenge
## Part 1 
Challenge includes plotting the earthquake data for the last month obtained from usgs website 
JSON (EarthQuakeData) - <https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson> was used to plot the data
The size of the circle Marker represents the earthquake magnitude and the color scheme represents the depth of quake origination.

## Part 2 
Challenge includes making basemap and overlaymaps layers to better represent the earthequake data. 
The data clearly shows a trend of quakes on the techtonic boundaries. 
The size of the circle Marker represents the earthquake magnitude and the color scheme represents the depth of quake origination. 
JSON(Tectonicplates) - <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json> was used to plot the techtonic plates
